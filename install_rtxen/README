This is the install script for the RT-Xen 1.0, which is developed based on Xen 4.1.4.
The ./install_rtxen folder should be place under the folder xen-4.1.4/ to run.
Please switch to root to run ./install_rtxen.sh to avoid Pemission problems.

Currently ./install_rtxen.sh is only tested working well on Fedora 18 (64bit). 
The script does the following steps to install RT-Xen:
1) Compile RT-Xen and install the modules and tools via Xen's installation system;
2) Generate the correct grub2 entry for RT-Xen:
	a) Backup your grub2 files;
	b) Replace the following files: grub2-mkconfig, /etc/grub.d/22_linux_rtxen, /etc/default/grub
    c) update your grub2 file: /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

You can change the parameters(memory, vcpu number, pin/not-pin) of Domain-0 by modifying the RT-Xen entries in the file /etc/default/grub, and updating the grub.cfg with the command "grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg"

#If you are using another Linux distribution
You can refer to ./install_rtxen.sh to generate your own grub2 entries for your system.
The 22_linux_rtxen script is still valid. 
The only changes are:
    a) copying the 22_linux_rtxen to the folder grub.d(where the script to generate grub.cfg) in your system; add the RT-Xen entries into the /etc/default/grub file in your system.
    b) changing the file (used to update the grub2) to import the RT-Xen parameter in file /etc/default/grub. For example, if you are using grub2-mkconfig to update your grub.cfg, you need to change the script /usr/sbin/grub2-mkconfig. 
    c) update your grub entries with the command in your own system.

Enjoy~
